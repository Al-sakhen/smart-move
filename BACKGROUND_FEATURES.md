# ThreeBackground Component - Enhanced Features

## Overview
The `ThreeBackground` component has been modernized to provide a sophisticated, business-oriented 3D background for the Smart Move website. It's now globally implemented in the root layout for consistent visual experience across all pages.

## New Features

### 1. **Enhanced Particle System**
- **3000 particles** with intelligent clustering
- **Color-coded particles** that adapt to dark/light themes
- **Additive blending** for ethereal glow effects
- **Dynamic clustering** to create focal points

### 2. **Floating Geometric Shapes**
- **5 interactive geometric shapes** representing different services:
  - **Box shapes**: Web Development & Business Solutions
  - **Spheres**: Mobile Development & Social Media
  - **Octahedron**: Marketing Services
- **Interactive hover effects** with opacity and color changes
- **Smooth floating animations** with individual timing delays
- **Wireframe to solid transitions** on hover

### 3. **Network Connection Lines**
- **Dynamic connection lines** between nodes
- **Animated opacity** for breathing effect
- **Represents connectivity** and modern tech solutions

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- **Multi-layered gradients** for depth
- **Animated mesh pattern overlay** with continuous movement
- **Improved lighting system** with multiple light sources
- **Better contrast overlays** for content readability

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Adaptive DPR** (Device Pixel Ratio) for performance
- **Frustum culling** enabled for better performance
- **Seeded random generation** for consistent results
- **Efficient re-rendering** with proper dependencies

## Technical Implementation

### Theme Integration
- **Automatic theme detection** using `next-themes`
- **Smooth transitions** between dark and light modes
- **Consistent color schemes** across all elements

### Global Implementation
- **Root layout integration** eliminates redundancy
- **Single background instance** across all pages
- **Consistent visual experience** throughout the site
- **Better performance** with single 3D context

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-optimized** performance settings
- **Scalable particle counts** based on device capabilities
- **Adaptive quality settings** for different devices

## Color Scheme

### Dark Theme
- **Primary**: Blue tones (#3b82f6)
- **Background**: Slate to indigo gradient
- **Particles**: Blue spectrum with additive blending

### Light Theme
- **Primary**: Purple tones (#8b5cf6)
- **Background**: Blue to purple gradient
- **Particles**: Purple spectrum with additive blending

## Business Context
The geometric shapes and network connections specifically represent Smart Move's core services:
- **Web Development**: Structured, reliable (boxes)
- **Mobile Development**: Versatile, encompassing (spheres)
- **Marketing**: Sharp, cutting-edge (octahedrons)
- **Business Solutions**: Solid, dependable (boxes)
- **Social Media**: Connected, engaging (spheres)

## Usage
The component is now automatically included on all pages through the root layout. No additional imports or implementations needed on individual pages.

```jsx
// Already implemented in src/app/layout.js
<ThreeBackground />
```

## Performance Notes
- Uses **React Three Fiber** for optimized 3D rendering
- **Canvas is only rendered client-side** to prevent hydration issues
- **Background gradient always renders** for consistent experience
- **Optimized for both desktop and mobile** devices
